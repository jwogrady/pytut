# Python Basics: Lesson 01

# The first thing you need to know is this is a `single line comment`.

MULTILINE COMMENTS

This is a multi-line comment. The triple quotes tells the Python interpreter to ignore this block of text.

For this lesson, I used all caps to denote subheading, but it's not necessary. You just need to remember that the Python will ignore everything after a # on a single line, and everything between triple quotes.
